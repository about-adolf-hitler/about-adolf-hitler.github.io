            <h2>About Pablo Escobar</h2>
            <p>Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (December 1, 1949 – December 2, 1993) was a Colombian drug lord and narco-terrorist who was the founder and sole leader of the Medellín Cartel. Born in Rionegro, Colombia, Escobar grew up in nearby Medellín. He studied briefly at Universidad Autónoma Latinoamericana of Medellin but left without a degree when he began to engage in criminal activity.</p>
            <p>Escobar's criminal empire included smuggling cocaine into the United States, where he supplied an estimated 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the country during the height of his career. His cartel was responsible for countless deaths and the corruption of Colombian politics.</p>
            <p>Despite his criminal activities, Escobar was viewed by some as a Robin Hood-like figure due to his charitable endeavors in Colombia, where he built hospitals, schools, and churches in poor communities.</p>
            <p>However, his reign of terror came to an end when he was killed by Colombian authorities in a rooftop shootout in 1993.</p>
