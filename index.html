            <h2>About Adolf Hitler</h2>
            <p>Adolf Hitler (April 20, 1889 – April 30, 1945) was a German politician and leader of the Nazi Party. He rose to power as Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and later Führer in 1934. Hitler's aggressive foreign policies triggered World War II and led to the genocide known as the Holocaust, resulting in the deaths of millions, including six million Jews.</p>
            <p>Hitler's regime pursued an ideology of racism, anti-Semitism, and ultranationalism. His actions and policies caused immense suffering and devastation during the war, and his regime was responsible for some of the greatest atrocities in human history.</p>
